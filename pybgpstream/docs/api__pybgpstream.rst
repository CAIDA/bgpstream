_pybgpstream
============

This document describes the API of the _pybgpstream module, a low-level
(almost) direct interface to the C `libbgpstream` library.

.. py:module:: _pybgpstream

BGPStream
---------

.. py:class:: BGPStream

   The BGP Stream class provides a single stream of BGP Records.

   .. py:method:: parse_filter_string(fstring)

      Adds filters to an unstarted BGP Stream instance, based on the filter
      string provided. Only those record/elements that match the filter(s)
      will be included in the stream.

      If multiple filters of the **same** type are added, a record/elem is
      considered a match if it matches **any** of the filters. For example,
      if a filter string `project routeviews and project ris` is used, then
      records that are from either the `Route Views` **or** the `RIS` project
      will be included.

      If filters of **different** types are added, a record/elem is considered
      a match only if it matches **all** of the filters. For example, if a
      filter string `project routeviews and prefix exact 1.2.3.0/24` is used,
      then only records that are both from the `Route Views` project **and**
      have a prefix of 1.2.3.0/24 are included.

      More information of the specifics of the filter string language and
      the filtering methods that it supports can be found with the libbgpstream
      documentation.

      :param str fstring: The filter string
      :raises TypeError: if the filter string is not a basestring
      :raises ValueError: if the filter string is invalid or badly formed

   .. py:method:: add_filter(type, value)

      Add a filter to an unstarted BGP Stream instance. Only those records/elems that
      match the filter(s) will be included in the stream.

      If multiple filters of the **same** type are added, a record/elem is considered
      a match if it matches **any** of the filters. E.g. if
      `add_filter('project', 'routeviews')` and `add_filter('project', 'ris')`
      are used, then records that are from either the `Route Views`, **or** the
      `RIS` project will be included.

      If multiple filters of **different** types are added, a record/elem is
      considered a match if it matches **all** of the filters. E.g. if
      `add_filter('project', 'routeviews')` and `add_filter('record-type',
      'updates')` are used, then records that are both from the `Route Views`
      project, **and** are `updates` will be included.

      `project`,  `collector`, and `record-type` filter BGP records,
      whereas `peer-asn`,  `prefix-exact`, `prefix-more`, `prefix-less`,
      `prefix-any`, `aspath`, `ipversion`, `elemtype` and `community` filter
      BGP elems. 

      The `prefix-*` filters selects BGP elems related to the
      prefix. `prefix-exact` will only match if the exact prefix appears in
      the element. `prefix-more` will match if the exact prefix or a more
      specific prefix is observed. `prefix-less` will match if the exact prefix
      or a less specific prefix is observed. `prefix-any` with match if any
      relevant prefix is observed, either more or less specific.

      The `aspath` filter is specifed as a regular expression and will match
      if the AS path matches the regular expression. `^` can be used to 
      represent the start of an AS path and `$` can be used to represent the
      end of an AS path. `_` can be used to separate adjacent ASNs in the
      path. E.g. if the filter value `^681_1444_` is used, only elements with
      an AS path beginning with AS681 followed by AS1444 will be included.

      The `ipversion` filter can be used to limit the stream to IPv4 or IPv6
      prefixes only. Use `4` to get IPv4 only and `6` to get IPv6 only.

      The `elemtype` filter can be used to limit the stream to only certain
      element types. Possible element types are `ribs`, `withdrawals`,
      `announcements` and `peerstates`.

      The `community` filter is specified as
      a `asn:value` formatted string, the user can specify the ASn or
      the value and leave the other field not specified using the `*`.
      E.g. if `add_filter('community', '*:300')` is used then all the BGP elems
      having at least one community with value `300` will be included.

      :param str type: The type of the filter, can be one of `project`,
		       `collector`, `record-type`, `peer-asn`, `prefix-exact`,
                       `prefix-more`, `prefix-less`, `prefix-any`,
                       `ipversion`, `aspath`, `community`, `elemtype`
      :param str value: The value of the filter
      :raises TypeError: if the type or value are not basestrings
      :raises ValueError: if the type is not valid


   .. py:method:: add_rib_period_filter(period)

      Set the RIB period filter for the current stream. Configure the
      minimum BGP time interval between two consecutive RIB  files
      that belong to the same collector. This information can be
      modified once the stream has started.

      :param int period: the period (in seconds)
      :raises TypeError: if the start or end period is not int


   .. py:method:: add_interval_filter(start, stop)

      Add an interval filter to an unstarted BGP Stream instance. Only those
      records that fall within the given interval will be included in the
      stream. Setting the `stop` parameter to `0` will enable live mode and
      effectively set an endless interval.

      If multiple interval filters are added, then a record is included if it is
      inside **any** of the intervals.

      :param int start: The start time of the interval (inclusive)
      :param int stop: The end time of the interval (inclusive)
      :raises TypeError: if the start or end times are not ints

   .. py:method::add_recent_interval_filter(interval, islive)

      Adds an interval filter to an unstarted BGP Stream instance, based on
      a time period described by a special interval string relative to the
      current time. Only those records that fall within the given interval
      will be included in the stream.

      The interval string takes the format "<number> <units>". The available
      units are 's', 'm', 'h', and 'd', for 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours',
      and 'days' respectively. For example, an interval string of "3 h" will
      fetch the most recent 3 hours of BGP data.

      :param str interval: the string describing the interval
      :param bool islive: if True, BGP Stream will continue to stream live
                          data once it has fetch the recent historical data.
      :raises TypeError: if the interval is not a string or islive cannot be
                         treated as a bool.

   .. py:method:: get_data_interfaces()

      Gets a list of information about the available data interfaces.
      Each item in the list will have three fields: `id`, `name`, and
      `description`. The value of the `name` field can be used in subsequent
      calls to :py:meth:`set_data_interface`.

   .. py:method:: set_data_interface(interface_name)

      Sets the data interface to stream BGP Records from.

      :param str interface_name: The data interface to use, must be one of the
                                 `name` fields in the result of
                                 :py:meth:`get_data_interfaces`.
      :raises TypeError: if the interface is not a basestring
      :raises ValueError: if the given interface is not valid


   .. py:method:: get_data_interface_options(interface_name)

      Gets a dictionary of options for the given data interface. (Availabie data
      interfaces may be discovered using :py:meth:`get_data_interfaces`.)

      :param str interface_name: The data interface to use, must be one of the
                                 `name` fields in the result of
                                 :py:meth:`get_data_interfaces`.
      :return: A dictionary of options for the given data interface.
      :rtype: dictionary
      :raises TypeError: if interface_name is not a basestring
      :raises ValueError: if the given interface name is not valid

   .. py:method:: set_data_interface_option(interface_name, opt_name, opt_value)

      Sets a data interface option.

      :param str interface_name: The data interface to use, must be one of the
                                 `name` fields in the result of
                                 :py:meth:`get_data_interfaces`.
      :param str opt_name: The option to set, must be one of the `name` fields
                           in the result of
                           :py:meth:`get_data_interface_options` for the given
                           data interface.
      :param str opt_value: The option value to set.
      :raises TypeError: if any of the parameters are not basestrings
      :raises ValueError: if the given data interface, or option name is not
                          valid


   .. py:method:: set_live_mode()

      Enables live mode. When this option is used, the stream will block
      waiting for new data to arrive if the end of the interval has not been
      reached. In this way a stream can be used to monitor realtime data (i.e. a
      call to :py:meth:`get_next_record` will block until new data is
      available.)


   .. py:method:: start()

      Starts the stream. This method must be called **after** all configuration
      options have been set (e.g. filters, options, etc.), and **before** the
      first call to :py:meth:`get_next_record`.


   .. py:method:: get_next_record(record)

      Retrieves the next record from the stream, and stores the result into the
      given record object. Passing a record instance helps reduce the allocation
      overhead of this method. If the records are processing independently of
      each other, then the same record instance may be used for subsequent calls
      to this method. If the blocking mode is enabled, then this method may
      block if the stream reaches the end of the data available in the archive,
      and the end of the interval(s) has not been reached.

      :param BGPRecord record: A record instance into which the next record from
			       the stream is stored.
      :return: True if there are more records in the stream, False if the end of
	       the stream has been reached.
      :rtype: bool
      :raises RuntimeError: if the provided record instance is invalid, if the
			    stream has not been started, or if the stream
			    encounters an error retrieving the next record
